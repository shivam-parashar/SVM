# SVM
Support Vector Machines(SVMs) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one or the other of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier. 
In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and related kernel methods have become increasingly popular tools for data mining tasks such as classification, regression, and novelty detection. The goal of this project is to provide an intuitive explanation of SVMs from a
geometric perspective. We used Sequential Minimal Optimization Algorithm for implementation.
